There are 52 cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one of 13 ranks. Represent a deck of cards as an array of Objects (*you may use the Vector class)
 Use integers to encode the ranks and suits
 Have suitable default &amp; parameterized constructors
 all data members to have private access
 The class ‘Card’ to have the following methods:
 createDeck() , printCard(), printDeck (), sameCard(),
compareCard(), sortCard() , findCard() which searches through an array of Cards to see whether it contains a certain card
 dealCards() function : to print 5 random cards from the existing deck.
